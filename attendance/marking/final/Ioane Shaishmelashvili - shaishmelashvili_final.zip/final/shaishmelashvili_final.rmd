### We see that volume of trade drops and it happens twice. The most significant is that period, when it drops, coincides with WWI and WWII periods. Based on this opinion, we may conclude, that plunge was caused by world wars.

summary(modeltradflo) ### based on data we can say, that wars affect trade between countries in a negative way, while if there is higher mutual interest between countries, trade pace rises. As far as TAUL has positive coefficient, we cam conclude, that mutual interests influence trade. Finnally saying, second version is OK, because there is not much to say against it.
