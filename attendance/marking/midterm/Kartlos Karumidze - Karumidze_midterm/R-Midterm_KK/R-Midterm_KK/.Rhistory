### 118 Females and 45 males participated in the study, 67% were 20 years old or younger and 33% were older than 20. As for political knowledge 93 participants received 2 points, 49 - 3 points, 10 - 4 points, 11 person received 1 point and one participant did not answer the question. The highest left-to-right score was 50 and mean was 35.38, so we could conclude that participants were more right leaning in terms of ideology.  Respondent's attitude towards politicians were more negative than positive as the mean score for the question q3_1 was 29.4 and their attitude towards institutions were more positive as the mean score for the question q6 was 53.80. 55 participants belonged to control group, 58 - direct elections group and 51 - indirect elections group.
tapply(stud$knowledge_score, stud$gender, mean, na.rm=TRUE) ### political knowledge difference
tapply(stud$ideological_score, stud$gender, mean, na.rm=TRUE)  ### difference in left-right leanings
tapply(stud$q6, stud$gender, mean, na.rm=TRUE) ### attitude towards politicians
tapply(stud$q3_1, stud$gender, mean, na.rm=TRUE) ### attitude towards presidency
### In terms of political knowledge male participants mean value is slightly bigger (2.46) than female participants mean value (2.31). In terms of Ideological score female participants mean value is slightly bigger (35.82) than male participants mean value (34.40). Female participants attitude toward politicians (54.64) were more positive than male participants attitude (51.40). While male participants have more positive attitude towards the presidency (33.26) compared to female participants mean value (27.74)

### Vast majority of Participants (75) who have 30 points or more in ideological score received 2 points in political knowledge. 36 right-winged participants received 3 points in political knowledge. 9 received - 4 points and 10 participants received - 1 point.
### 56 Participants with 2 points in political knowledge have 30 points or more in the question measuring attitude towards politicians. 24 Participants with 3 points in political knowledge have 30 points or more in the question measuring attitude towards politicians. 6 Participants with 4 points in political knowledge have 30 points or more in the question measuring attitude towards politicians. 5 Participants with 1 points in political knowledge have 30 points or more in the question measuring attitude towards politicians.
### So it could be concluded that participants with average political knowledge are more right-winged and the have more positive attitude towards politicians.

sd(exp_i, na.rm=TRUE) ### standard deviations for Indirect elections groups attitudes toward the institutions
mean(exp_i, na.rm=TRUE) ### mean values for Indirect elections groups attitudes toward the institutions
### There are high standard deviation that indicates that data is widely spread (less reliable)
cor.test(stud$q3_1, stud$q6, method=c("pearson"))
### Mean values of the attitudes toward the institutions of Direct elections groups (0.34) and control groups (31) are higher than Indirect elections groups (0.27), however high standard deviation makes that data less reliable and the p-value = 0.06251 indicates that there is weak   evidence against the null hypothesis.
