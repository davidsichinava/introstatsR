## Hypothesis 1:
### Civil wars lead to decreases in total bilateral trade.

## Hypothesis 2:
### Given that a civil war is occurring in at least one trade partner, the presence of an alliance will increase levels of bilateral trade.

## Hypothesis 3:
### One countryâ€™s participation in another countryâ€™s civil war decreases the bilateral trade between the joiner and each trading partner.
