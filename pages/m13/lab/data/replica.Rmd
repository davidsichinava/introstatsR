## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
bayrup <- read.csv("bayrup.csv")

names(bayrup)

ggplot(bayrup, aes(x=dtrade))+
  geom_histogram()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(bayrup)


model <- lm(dtrade~Ldist+Ldytr+Lgdp1P+Lgdp2P+Lpop1P+
              Lpop2P+mid+alliance+equwartau+
              demmultdyad+civilwar+cw_join+outnegshort+outdecshort, 
            data=bayrup)

summary(model)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(stargazer)
modelprint <- stargazer(model,
                        title="My Regresison Model",
                        type = "html",
                        align=TRUE
                        )
kable(modelprint)
```
